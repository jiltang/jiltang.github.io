      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a GENDER-NONCONFORMING LION. In my spare time I wrestle hyenas. I like long walks on the beach,
        big D, and fried chicken. I also code convoluted code and write even more convoluted essays.
      </p>
      <p>In a past life, I lived in Arkansas. Now, I live in Kansas, which is a big improvement. You can find me
        fleeing hurricanes in the American Southwest or hiking through monsoons in India. This has informed
        my interest in weather balloons, which I am currently working on sending into large hurricanes in the
        Pacific.</p>
      <p>I am a member of the Stanford NLP group working with Prof. Chris Manning. I'm also a member on
        Stanford NLP's Chirpy Cardinal team, helping to develop a perceptive, empathetic chatbot for the
        Alexa Prize 4 competition. I also have research interests in statistics and bioinformatics.</p>
